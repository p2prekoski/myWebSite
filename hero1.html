        Mario is a video game character created in 1983. He has been around my whole childhood and is a         classic video game character. He has a very basic storyline but it gets the job done and makes           for a great plot in a video game. Him and his brother Luigi must save the Princess Peach from           the evil turtle, Bowser. Bowser takes her away to his castle in a giant ship along with his             cremates that are also bad guys. Mario goes on an epic adventure with his friends and brother to         save the princess and get her home safely. They must pass through different terrains and                 accomplish challenges along the way.

        I think Mario is a hero because he will stop at nothing to help one of his friends. He is a             great example for kids and a good role model for kids to be watching/playing with. He also               brings back lots of memories and nostalgia to people all around the world spreading joy and             happiness without even trying. Although he is a fictional character he can entertain kids for           hours, and is a classic symbol of the video game world.
